#PyroCMS 3 Semantic-ui Theme

Semantic offers complete design freedom. High level variables and an intuitive inheritance system lets you change the look and feel of your components with just a handful of lines

## Instructions 

* Inside your PyroCMS 3 intallation's `addons` folder, create either `default` (or `shared`) folder.

* Copy your theme's files into the Vendor sub-folder `addons/default/websemantics`
  
* In your distribution config file `config/distribution.php` set the value of `public_theme` to `Websemantics\SemanticuiTheme\SemanticuiTheme`

* Go to `addons/default/websemantics/semanticui-theme/resources/build/` folder and run the bash file `./build.sh`. This will compile install node modules, compile semantic-ui and copy css, js etc files to the respective theme folders (css, js, fonts etc). You might be prompted to enter the root password.

* To override the theme, write your styles in prompted `addons/default/websemantics/semanticui-theme/resources/build/semantic-site`

* Enjoy
